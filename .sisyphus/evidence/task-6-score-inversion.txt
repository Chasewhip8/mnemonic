Task 6 evidence: score inversion applied consistently (distance -> similarity).

Code excerpts (src/service.ts):
- injectTrace():
  - 374: const similarity = 1 - Number(row.distance ?? 0);
  - 379: similarity_score: similarity,
  - 380: passed_threshold: similarity >= threshold,
- query():
  - 432: vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector32(?)) as distance
  - 435: ORDER BY distance ASC
  - 444: similarity: 1 - Number(row.distance ?? 0),
- getLearningNeighbors():
  - 501: const similarity = 1 - Number(row.distance ?? 0);
  - 505: passed: similarity >= threshold,

Bun verification output:
async learn(: true
vector32(?): true
async inject(: true
vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector32(?)) as distance: true
ORDER BY distance ASC: true
async injectTrace(: true
similarity_score: true
async query(: true
async getLearningNeighbors(: true
vector_to_json(embedding) as embedding_json: true
1 - Number(row.distance ?? 0): true

Result: no VECTORIZE usage in src/service.ts; vector operations use raw this.db.execute() with score inversion semantics.
