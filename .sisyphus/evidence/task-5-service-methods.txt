Task 5 Evidence: Service Methods Ported

== Exported Interfaces (9) ==
$(grep 'export interface' src/service.ts)

== Exported Class ==
$(grep 'export class' src/service.ts)

== Private Helpers (4) ==
$(grep 'private ' src/service.ts | grep -v 'private db\|private drizzle')

== Async Methods (13) ==
$(grep 'async ' src/service.ts)

== Constructor ==
$(grep -A3 'constructor(' src/service.ts)

== setSecret uses INSERT OR REPLACE pattern ==
$(grep -A3 'INSERT INTO secrets' src/service.ts)

== learn stub present ==
$(grep -A2 'async learn(' src/service.ts)

== convertDbLearning returns undefined for embedding ==
$(grep 'embedding:' src/service.ts | grep -v 'interface\|number')

== Method count ==
async methods: $(grep -c 'async ' src/service.ts)
private helpers: $(grep 'private ' src/service.ts | grep -v 'private db\|private drizzle' | wc -l)
total: 17

Note: Plan asserted >= 15 async methods but only 13 async methods are in Task 5 scope.
Vector methods (inject, query, getLearningNeighbors, learn impl) are Task 6.
