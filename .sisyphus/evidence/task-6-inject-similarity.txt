Task 6 evidence: inject() uses distance ASC and converts to similarity.

Source: src/service.ts

286: const embedding = await createEmbedding(context);
289: sql: `SELECT ..., vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector32(?)) as distance
293:       ORDER BY distance ASC
294:       LIMIT ?`,
300: .map((row) => ({
302:   similarity: 1 - Number(row.distance ?? 0),

Result: retrieval is sorted by lowest cosine distance first; API path computes similarity as (1 - distance).
