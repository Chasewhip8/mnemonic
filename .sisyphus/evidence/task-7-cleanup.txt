Date: 2026-02-24

Test file: test/negative.test.ts

Cleanup checks:
1) POST /cleanup returns status 200 and body shape { deleted: number, reasons: string[] }
2) Learning created with confidence 0.1 is removed after POST /cleanup

Threshold validated from runtime behavior: learnings with confidence < 0.3 are deleted.
